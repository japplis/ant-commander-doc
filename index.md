Most of the actions are available in the menu bar of the application. The main actions are available in the toolbar and status bar of the application and of the panel.
Example of actions: Go to a directory, Copy Files, Show Settings.
Some actions are specific to a plug-in, like Zoom is only for the Image Viewer (Pro) plug-in.
